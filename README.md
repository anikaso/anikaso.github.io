Anika Sompuram's Coding Portfolio: My name is Anika Sompuram and I am currently a junior at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. I am double majoring in Economics (B.S.) and Statistics (B.S.) with a minor in Data Science. I have strong experience using Python, SQL, Tableau, and R-Studio to analyze datasets and create visual diagrams. I have limited proficiency in Java as well. Iâ€™m passionate about using data to drive insights and solve real-world problems, and I am excited to apply my skills and explore innovative solutions in my field. This is a portfolio of past coding projects I have completed to showcase my skills.
